/**
 * Represents a Truc match, managing all the logic and states of the game.
 *
 * Based on: https://injovemenorca.com/ca/Truc_menorqui/34773
 *
 * ### Overview:
 * This class encapsulates the rules and flow of a Truc match, including player turns, laps, rounds,
 * scoring, and special cases. It supports two teams with two players each and is designed to handle
 * the traditional rules of Truco as well as potential future rule mutators.
 *
 * ### Key Definitions:
 * - **TURN**: When a player throws one card.
 * - **LAP**: When all players have thrown one card.
 * - **ROUND**: When three laps are completed, or fewer if a special case occurs.
 *
 * ### Key Features:
 * - **Players and Teams**: Manages players and their respective teams.
 * - **Game State**: Tracks the state of the game, including truc and envit states.
 * - **Turn Management**: Handles the order of turns and laps using queues.
 * - **Scoring**: Calculates and updates scores based on game rules and special cases.
 * - **Special Cases**: Implements special cases for Truc and Envit scenarios.
 * - **Randomized Start**: Randomly selects the starting player for each round.
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - Currently supports only two teams with two players each.
 * - Future enhancements may include support for more players and customizable rules via mutators.
 * - The class is designed to notify clients of state changes and updates.
 *
 * ### Key Properties:
 * - **players**: Array containing all players in the match.
 * - **team1, team2**: Arrays representing the two teams.
 * - **trucState, envitState**: Current states of truc and envit.
 * - **turnQueue**: Queue managing the order of turns in a lap.
 * - **roundInfiniteQueue**: Infinite queue managing the order of players across rounds.
 * - **roundMaPlayer**: Player who starts the round (the "m√†").
 * - **score**: Object tracking the score of both teams.
 *
 * ### Constants:
 * - **WIN_SCORE**: The score required to win the match.
 * - **TIE**: Constant representing a tie.
 * - **trucScore**: Object mapping truc states to their respective scores.
 * - **envitScore**: Object mapping envit states to their respective scores.
 *
 * ### Key Methods:
 * - **getState()**: Returns the current state of the game.
 * - **playerCall(player: Player, callType: CallType)**: Handles player actions like truc, envit, or abandoning.
 * - **playerPlay(player: Player, cardId: cardId)**: Handles a player's card play and updates the game state.
 * - **startNextRound()**: Prepares the game for the next round.
 * - **updateMatchScore(roundState: roundState)**: Updates the match score based on the round's outcome.
 * - **isMatchOver()**: Checks if a team has won the match.
 * - **shuffleCards()**: Shuffles and distributes cards to players.
 * - **assignEnvitToPlayers()**: Calculates and assigns envit values to players.
 * - **getPlayerFromUser(userUserName: string)**: Retrieves a player object by username.
 * - **deletePlayer(player: Player)**: Removes a player from the match.
 * - **getPlayerTeam(player: Player)**: Returns the team of a given player.
 *
 * ### Example Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const trucMatch = new TrucMatch(["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"]);
 * const state = trucMatch.getState();
 * console.log(state);
 * ```
